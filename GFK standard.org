* Pairs
** core
Pairs are a block of 8bytes.
4bytes for block address and 4bytes for checksum of the block

If the superblock checksum flag is not turned on, the checksum value should be zero

*** Checksum algorithm
uint32_t computeChecksum(const void *data, size_t size)
{
	uint32_t res = 0;
	const uint32_t *d = static_cast<const uint32_t *>(data);
	assert((size & (sizeof(uint32_t) - 1)) == 0);
	size /= sizeof(uint32_t);
	for (size_t i = 1; i != size; ++i)
          res = (res << 31) + (res >> 1) + d[i];
	return res;
}

** Directory Pairs
made up of 2 pairs.
The first for the name and the second for the file block address.

[block address][checksum] (block with filename)
[block address][checksum] (block with file contents)

* Blocks
The filesystem is made up of 512byte blocks.
The first pair of every block structure is its type.

| Value | Type               |
|-------+--------------------|
|     0 | Direct File        |
|     1 | Indirect File      |
|     2 | Directory          |
|     3 | Indirect Directory |

** Superblock
The superblock is located at the last logical block.
To compenstate for hardware that doesn't make knowing the size of the drive simple, the 2nd logical block just stores the block address of the superblock.

Each piece is 64bits long (8bytes)
